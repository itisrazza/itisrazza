### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm yet another nerd doing a Software Engineering degree. The obvious stuff aside, I like working on various small projects that I find useful. A lot of these projects are from back when I was learning how to program in new areas, but Uni and work are a thing now.

Here are some highlights:

* [CoronaBot](https://github.com/thegreatrazz/coronabot) - Discord bot for coorditing lectures and deadlines + a few other things
* [VGAPainter](https://github.com/thegreatrazz/VGAPainter) - I wanted to learn VGA programming on DOS at some point
* [Tetris](https://github.com/thegreatrazz/tetris) - It's a terrible Tetris clone. In C++. Deal with it.

I also dump some other things when I'm done with them.

### Hard Skills

**`JavaScript` `C#` `C` `PHP`** `HTML` `CSS` `MySQL` `TypeScript` `Java` `Vala` `Visual Basic` `bash` *`Vue.js` `GatsbyJS` `Rust` `Swift` `Lua` `Kotlin`*

I started coding back in 2010 with Visual Basic, but have since moved on to more "serious" languages.

### Soft Skills

They exist... I swear.

### Interests

I also like taking photos, and read, write and speak languages I don't use on a daily basis (French, Japanese atm). Don't have much to show for them.
