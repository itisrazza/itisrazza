### ðŸ‘‹ Salut!

I'm yet another nerd doing a Software Engineering degree. The obvious stuff aside, I like working on various small projects that I find useful. A lot of these projects are from back when I was learning how to program in new areas, but Uni and work are a thing now.

Here are some highlights:

* [CoronaBot](https://github.com/thegreatrazz/coronabot) - Discord bot for announcing lectures and deadlines + a few other things
* [VGAPainter](https://github.com/thegreatrazz/VGAPainter) - I wanted to learn VGA programming on DOS at some point, so here's a graphics editor
* [Tetris](https://github.com/thegreatrazz/tetris) - It's a terrible Tetris clone. In C++. Deal with it.

I also dump some other things when I'm done with them.
